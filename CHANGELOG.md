# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Correctness

- Preserved exact sub-microsecond timing through periodic compression and replay.
- Rejected ambiguous mixed timestamp/gap traces and conflicting timing fields.
- Added queue-aware deterministic scheduler model v4 and counter-based randomness.
- Reconciled report metrics, breakdowns, samples, and calibration data.
- Hardened one-rank skew, pattern sums, interval coverage, integer, and finite-number validation.

### Research fidelity

- Added optional measured `observed_exposed_us` as a joint timing feature.
- Added model calibration error to reports.
- Added lossless compilation mode and explicit approximation budgets.
- Added prefix-cumulative-gap error and serialized-byte compression metrics.
- Added phase- and operation-level regression localisation.

### Capture

- Added UUID-qualified shard names and generation-ordered saves.
- Rejects mixed capture sessions, conflicting workload/session metadata, missing or duplicate ranks, and partially observed latency.
- Preserves clock uncertainty instead of inventing cross-rank skew.
- Validates recorder inputs before storage.

### Performance

- Uses incremental source hashing, direct timing comparisons, compact replay arrays, and event-local counter-based random generation.
